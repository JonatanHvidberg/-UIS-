#How to use the program

##First create the database 'diabetes' for the user postgres

1. From the terminal
	- sudo psql -U postgres
2. Inside the psql terminal
	- CREATE DATABASE diabetes;
	- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE diabetes TO postgres;
3. Exiting the psql terminal, and running the following command from the  terminal
	- psql -d diabetes -U postgres -f minSP.sql
 	- psql -d diabetes -U postgres -f Data.sql

##Running the prototype
1. Run the script 'run.py' with python3, ie "$ python3 run.py", this will start up the flask server on the local host, and the webpage "http://127.0.0.1:5000" will show the prototype.

2. Log in with any of the defined users' cpr number [2503902323, 2405952323, 2110992324], all having no password, but the form requires some input before it can be submitted. The user 2503902323 has the most data connected to them.

3. The first page that is loaded is the profile page, displaying information about the user, name, phone number and email address. All of these are made up to just showcase the possiblities. At the moment a banner in yellow reading "Nyheder om COVID-19" is shown, click on this will take on to "Sundhedsstyrelsen"'s page about the COVID-19 situation in Denmark.
