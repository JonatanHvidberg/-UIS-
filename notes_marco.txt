REMEBER to add a reflection on how you lived up to the principle of the MUST method! 

the vision for change is a little shallow, you are suggesting a new GUI and search function which seems unrelated with the target group and not clearly linked to the problems you found in the last phase. 

This work needs a severe improvement, because as for now is too shallow. Clearly this is a draft therefore I believe that the improvements are in your pipeline. 

Rememebr to add a section with the reflection on the principles of the MUST method. 

And populate your vision with visual aids, since the only part you will consider is UI. 

Also try to elaborate on the search function, why is needed? How will it work? What problems will it solve? Work is needed.
